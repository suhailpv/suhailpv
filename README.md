Problem Definition: The problem is to develop a fake news detection model using a Kaggle dataset. 
The goal is to distinguish between genuine and fake news articles based on their titles and text.
This project involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data, building a machine learning model for classification,
and evaluating the model's performance.
